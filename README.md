API Integration
Features
Content-based Filtering: Uses movie data such as genres, plot, and ratings to recommend movies similar to the ones the user likes.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes movie data using Pandas and NumPy to make it suitable for modeling.
Streamlit Interface: Interactive and easy-to-use frontend built with Streamlit for smooth user interaction.

How It Works
The system uses a content-based filtering approach where it analyzes movie features like genres and ratings to recommend similar movies to the user.
After preprocessing the data, the model compares movies based on content vectors and makes predictions for the userâ€™s next favorite movie.
The Streamlit app allows the user to interactively input preferences and get recommendations in real-time.
